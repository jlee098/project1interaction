        We often hear broad-brush exhortations to think big: for example, “Dream it,
        and you can <br> do it!” Less often touted is that fortune cookie’s more rational
        advice as well as in this one: <br> “Land is always in a flying bird’s mind.” In analyzing
        what to do, prioritize risk/reward <br> and opportunity cost: what you could otherwise do with the time and
        perhaps money.
